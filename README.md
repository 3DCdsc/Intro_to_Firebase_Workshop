## FAQ

1. Will a recording of this be accessible after this session?

   - Yep, it will be on our [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/3dcdsc) for 14 days after the session. We are also working on uploading these on a Youtube channel so more people can benefit :)

2. How do get the files on my computer to work with?
   - The ZIP way:
     - At the top-right corner of this Git Repository, click on the "Code" button.
     - Click "Download ZIP" and you should be able to unzip and use the files!
   - Using `git` - refer to our tutorial covered in an earlier workshop [here](https://github.com/3DCdsc/Intro_to_Git_Workshop/blob/master/2_Git_With_Github.md#43-cloning-the-repository).
